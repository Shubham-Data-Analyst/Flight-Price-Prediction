# Flight-Price-Prediction

The RandomForestRegressor and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models were applied to predict flight prices based on various features. The RandomForestRegressor exhibited exceptional performance, with a nearly perfect fit as evidenced by an R-squared value of 0.9999 and negligible Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). This indicates an accurate and precise prediction of flight prices. On the other hand, the KNN model also demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, achieving an impressive R-squared value of 0.9946 and moderate MAE and MSE. Both models effectively captured patterns in the data, offering robust options for predicting flight prices, with the RandomForestRegressor showcasing slightly superior performance. Consideration should be given to the specific requirements and characteristics of the problem when selecting the most suitable model.
